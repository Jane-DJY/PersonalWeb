                    <p>Hi there, and welcome to my little corner of the universe~~ ‚ú®</p>
                    <p>Right now, I'm a visualization product manager on a mission to cook up some delightfully innovative products.</p>
                    <p>I graduated from Sun Yat-sen University with a degree in financial journalism, then spent five whirlwind years as a data news editor. I've been telling stories with data ever since‚Äîsometimes even turning them into data art!</p>
                    <p>Once upon a time, I dreamed of becoming a PhD. I even wrote a few papers during the application grind (one made it into a top journal‚Äîyay!). In the end, though, I chose to dive into the corporate world. Who knows? Maybe one day that academic spark will reignite. The future's full of surprises!</p>
                    <p>My work has been shortlisted for the Information is Beautiful Awards, and I've won multiple honors from the PacificVis Visual Data Storytelling Contest, the China Data Content Competition, and more. Let's just say‚Äîmy data likes to show off a little. üòâ</p>

                            This video visualizes the structural roots of gender disparities in global investment through a lighthouse model. By mapping economic, legal, and educational data from around the world, it reveals how foundational systems shape women's access to investment and financial autonomy.

                            Clouds mirror the ground's activity‚Äîvolcanoes, wars, and forests all imprint the sky. Twin Cloud uses global meteorological data to generate clouds that reflect local conditions. Sulfur dioxide signals industry; sea salt suggests coastal traits. As pollution grows, clouds shift from gentle to violent.

In the first Asian Games, women were only allowed to participate in track and field events. By the 2010 Guangzhou Asian Games, all major events were finally open to women for the first time!

                            Through IMDB data analysis, we discovered that popular movies are indeed gradually increasing in length, especially in the years following the pandemic. Moreover, longer movies receive substantial financial investments, with high star salaries and astonishing marketing costs, with most resources concentrated on just a few films.

It also extends to the evolution of the "Two Sessions" report content, reflecting changes in China's political system operation and national governance priorities.
